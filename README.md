My Project 1 - Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to TIC TAC TOE! My first project for GA. 

Big Goals
-- Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
Use your programming skills to work out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
Build an application to a specification that someone else gives you
Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete from the same computer
Craft a README.md file that explains your app to the world

README Suggestions
List technologies used
Link to wireframes and user stories.
Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
Describe how you solved for the winner
Describe how some of your favorite functions work

Technical Requirements
Your Tic Tac Toe app must:
*Render a game board in the browser
*Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
*Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row, or show a draw if neither player wins
*Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
*Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
*Use JavaScript and/or jQuery for DOM manipulation
*Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
*You can use GitHub Pages for deploying your project
*Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
*Have well-formatted, and well-commented code

User Stories
As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
As a user, I should not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
As a user, I should be able to play the game again without refreshing the page

Potential Extra Tic Tac Toe Features
Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win, lose and tie counter
Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
Use localStorage to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
Involve Audio in your game
Create an AI opponent: teach JavaScript to play an unbeatable game against you
Make your site fully responsive so that it is playable from a mobile phone
Get inventive with your styling e.g. use hover effects or animations
Super Potential Extra Tic Tac Toe Features
Allow 2 players to play online with each other using any means such as WebSockets, Firebase, or other 3rd-party services.
